   <i>Atmospherics is the sphere in which boundaries between bodies, and distinctions between bodies and matters, human and nonhuman, can be not only negotiated but crossed.</i>
<br></br>
   - Giuliana Bruno, Atmospheres of Projection: Environmentality in Art and Screen Media (2022)

<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>Jessica Arseneau's artistic practice is multidisciplinary, however multi-channel video is usually the starting point for an installation accompanied by, among other things, sound, text, light and photographs to construct an atmospheric space. She examines the way human perception is shaped by technological progress, with an interest in the imaginary future and the expectation of it, which she believes is primarily a reflection of the present. She therefore uses science fiction narratives, mythologies, critical observations, and personal stories, which she activates in the various components of the work.
<p>She uses the atmospheric nature of the exhibition space so that it acquires its own temporality. Artificial and natural light as much as darkness, both as medium and image is a subject of exploration. It contributes to the enveloping atmosphere which also often has a poetic and cinematic character in a broad sense. Poetry carries a structure of rationality within the work or exhibition space and acts as a catalyst for conceptual and formal elements.</p>
<br></br>
Originally from Tilley Road in the Acadien Peninsula, she holds a bachelor of Fine Arts at Université de Moncton in 2011 and a master in Media Arts (German Media Art Diploma) with distinction at the Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig (HGB) in 2020.
<br></br>
Her solo exhibitions include among others <i>Soleil immobile</i> at Motoco, Mulhouse, <i>Surrounding Uncaring Skies</i> at Galerie d'art Louise-et-Reuben-Cohen, Moncton, <i>The Screen Under My Eyelids</i> at Helmut, Leipzig, and <i>Nothing but a Constant Glow</i> at Spinnerei Archiv Massiv, Leipzig, 2020.
<br></br>
Her work has been exhibited at Rencontres Internationales Paris/Berlin, Bandung Photography Triennale, Bandung, Galerie der HFBK, Hamburg, Ringlokschuppen Ruhr, Mülheim, D21 Kunstraum, Leipzig, Festival 9ph, Lyon, Friche la Belle de Mai, Marseille, Traverse Vidéo, Toulouse, Fonderie Darling, Montreal, Galerie Sans Nom, Moncton and a&o Kunsthalle Leipzig.
<br></br>
<p>Since 2021, she is part of the artists' collective ΔDELTA</p>
