<h4>Artistic approach</h4>

    <br>Throughout my practice, I try to weave the fields of social and individual imaginary with an aesthetic gesture that includes performance practices and installations. I examine in the porous borders between the inside and the outside by being interested in the multiple forms of reciprocal transformations between the individual and the surrounding space. Therefore, I use references of the urban landscape, audio snatches and visual fragments collected from public places or intimate encounters. 
 </br>
    
    <br>There is frequently a physical meeting with a material or a cultural substance.This dialectic between body and object comes to the construction of social imaginary and the individual that undergoes mutual transformation according to place and history. This is the case in my recent video and performance pieces where I used scaffolding, concrete and window blinds in literal interaction with the human body. In other cases, it is through the installation in a space, the musical references or the voice where emerges a metaphoric orchestration.
</br>

<br>The work takes shape with repetitions, whether with the configuration of objects, the rythm of a sequence or a gesture. They recall to a reserve of experiences that forms a contemporary between reality and its representation. Along these lines, my artistic process reveals a status of "passage", a certain mobility. I am Acadian and I exile myself in various cities where the wandering allows to take notes and temporal markers, but also to leave ephemeral traces of this passage.
