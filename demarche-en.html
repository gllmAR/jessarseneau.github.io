<h4>Artistic approach</h4>

    <br>My approach is based on dialectical of contraries in which I try to weave the fields of social and individual imaginary with an aesthetic gesture that includes performance practices and installations. I examine the porous borders between the inside and the outside by being interested in the multiple forms of reciprocal transformations between the individual and the surrounding space. Therefore, I use references of the urban landscape, audio snatches and visual fragments collected in public and intimate places. 
 </br>
    
    <br>In those researches, the physical meeting with the material settles in opposition from a project to another. The places that I use are sometimes cluttered, per example a shopping mall or a lighting store, and then uncluttered, like a large field or a wasteland. Sounds oscillate between abstract/concrete, images reflect themes of the internal/external and articulation/disarticulation.
</br>
    
<br>In the various projects, the body is often called to interact within the piece to refer to the mutual transformations of the individual and its space : in a performance or a video, the body will be subjected to a cultural substance whereas in an installation, the visitor is invited to roam through.  The first case is seen in the video piece titled <i>Lost Idyll</i>, where a woman pulls her scaffolding on wheels through the vast fields and a forest. This piece presents the metaphor of a structure to which we are subjected, the construction of a social, post-capitalist environment, that joins in a tension between the individual, the collective and the fictitious imaginary.
</br>

<br>
I assign a significant importance for the places where I work. Areas marked of collective memory and current users, I believe that they are a plinth of some artwork. This is where emerge projects such as <i>Walking A Cappella</i> where I recorded the singing of eight women from Alexandria to make an echo of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 while amplifying their voices. Recently, I have also explored some areas that devoids of urban references like a wasteland. Those lands, abandoned by the real estate market are poetic spaces of all possibilities. 
</br>

<br>From installations to performances, the work often takes shape with repetitions, whether it is with the configuration of objects or a gesture’s rhythm. They recall to a reserve of experiences that forms an individual and collective imaginary within the socio-political structures of the everyday life. Along these lines, my practice reveals a state of "passage": I am Acadian and I roam in various cities where the wandering allows to collect notes, temporal markers and landmarks, but also to leave ephemeral traces of this passage.
