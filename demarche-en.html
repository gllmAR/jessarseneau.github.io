    <br> When giving something, the principle of loss is intrinsic to the gesture. Something less – no matter the form, nor type of belonging – in the archive of the material and immaterial possessions from the one who gives. It pierces the wheel of reciprocal gains and the household of our daily interactions. The form of the gift and the form of the action come both back and forth in a dialogue. It can be a repetition of the same act, repeated over time, to create said form.
 
    <br></br>

Often using performance as a primary medium, Arseneau's work weaves source material taken from human interactions and gestures, stock image websites and found places. Documentation of performances are often transformed into video, photography, or installation to become an autonomous piece. Sought is the fine line between the documented and its fiction, as human activities often operate in a narrative structure or are conducted by a reifying force. Landscapes, the social, the historical and the imaginary, are in constant alteration engendered by systems of representation. 

       <br></br>
These sometimes incomprehensible dynamics trigger Arseneau's work, where the body, human or non-human, enters into interruption. The result is a configuration in space that suggests a suspended narrative – an implausible storyline existing in a temporal state between successive, created actions of drama, and actions which have already taken place.

           <br></br>
