    <br> When giving something, the principle of loss is intrinsic to the gesture. Something less – no matter the form, nor type of belonging – in the archive of the material and immaterial possessions from the one who gives. It pierces the wheel of reciprocal gains and the household of our daily interactions. The form of the gift and the form of the action come both back and forth in a dialogue. It can be a repetition of the same act, repeated over time, to create said form.
 
    <br></br>

Working with various media, Jessica Arseneau investigates systems of representation and their interactions with human activity. The communication faculty of an urban landscape, the use and emergence of stock images, architecture of places and gestures of the human body are revealed as spheres of research or as a medium. Sought is the fine line between the documented and the fiction, which possibly is an extension of reality. If human activities often operate in a narrative structure or are conducted by a reifying force, it happens within a set of representation and transforms the social, the historical and the imaginary landscapes. In Jessica Arseneau's work, the body, human or non-human, enters in interruption with a place and an image scenery. The document of performance becomes a video or a photograph in order to excerpt the fictive. Installed in the public or the exhibition space, the work often weaves a set of unrelated moments that meet or contrast through formal or conceptual parameters.
