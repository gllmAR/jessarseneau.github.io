<h4>About</h4>

    <br> <img src="2016_mille_fois_rien_higher_rez.jpg"> </br>
    <br> Jessica Arseneau (born 1988, Bathurst, Canada) is a multidisciplinary artist currently living in Leipzig, Germany. She works across a variety of media, from performance to video, drawing and installation. She aims to create a contemporary access to landscapes with ephemeral structures and the human body as a connector through objects and sites. It unfolds as allegories to phenomenons in urbanisation, to particular events, and the handling of spaces. Recent themes in her work have been the effervescence of the spectacle in the city (e.g. <i>Lost Idyll</i>, 2015), fragmentation (e.g. <i>Stratas</i>, 2015), forced or fantasized displacements (e.g. <i> A Thousand Time Nothing</i>, 2016, and <i>Transitory</i>, 2014). 

    <br></br>
    
Her work recalls the manipulation of fiction and reality, a system of representation which imprints rituals and behaviours. Therefore it intertwines the human body’s gestures with collective imaginary such as music and objects from households, which functions are shifting. Her coming up piece which will be shown at the Rundgang of HGB Leipzig questions the dialectics between process and obsolescence. Entitled <i> Factor of Beat </i>, this piece is a performance where a percusionnist plays on an iced snare drum which will melt as she continues to play. 

    <br></br>

    She received her B.A. from the Université de Moncton (2011) and was a member of the cooperative artist studio Atelier King Kong from 2013 to 2015 (Montreal). Public presentations of her work occurred at art spaces such as Darling Foundry (Montreal), BronxArtSpace (New York), Galerie Sans Nom (Moncton) and Janaklees for Visual Arts (Alexandrie). Recently, her work has been shown at Traverse Vidéo (Toulouse), HGB Galerie (Leipzig) and Galerie Bipolar (Leipzig).
