\f0\fs24 \cf0  The image has a poetic power.\uc0\u8232 \
   <p>It maintains a visual force which, to use the words of Bachelard, "opens up a future of language". It is activated by the anatomy of which it is constituted. Still image, moving image, sequential image, referential image, research image, parasitic image, subversive image, reproduced image, interrupted image. The power of image poetry is defined by its ability to override the dominant visual regime, today closely related to temporal structures. Images subordinate to these structures that respond to the subjugation of flickering luminosity, rhythmic sequencing, synchronicity and acceleration. Proliferation of non-times. Non-times that substitute the spaces left for daydreaming and heterogeneous times, leaving no interstices for the mind that drifts towards its confabulations of pure inconsistencies. The poetics of the image takes up the uncontrollable reverie. It inflicts caesura. Caesura. Making it indeterminate. The image is standstill or suspension, which becomes a counter-sequence. A counter-temporality, perhaps, where there is rupture; An interrupted temporal order.</p>}
